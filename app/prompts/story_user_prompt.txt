## Your Instructions

Transform the events described into a gripping first-person horror story. You are the narrator — this happened to YOU.

Rules:
- Preserve the core events and details from the source material faithfully
- Expand the narrator's internal experience: their heartbeat, their breathing, what they smell, what their hands are doing
- The motion detection box is not a bug — treat it as a real, malevolent presence
- The final notification "Motion detected — Behind You" must be the last line of the story
- Add one original sensory detail the original post didn't mention — something small that makes it feel real (a smell, a sound from childhood, the feeling of the floor)
- Do NOT explain what the entity is — ambiguity is the point
